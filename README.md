GiiBiiAdvance
=============

Another GB, GBC and GBA emulator.

This is an emulator I started a few years ago. I haven't released any version since 0.1.0, but I've done some changes that have improved compatibility anyway.

I'm currently porting the Win32 GUI to SDL2.

This has been compiled in Linux Mint 16 and Windows 7 succesfuly.
