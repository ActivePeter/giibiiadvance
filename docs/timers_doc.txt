DIV register
------------

Increases every 256 oscilator clocks.

If writen, its value is reseted to 0, as well as the internal counter.

-Interaction with timer explained below.
-Interaction with sound hardware to be determined.

TIMER
-----

Shares the internal counter with DIV register. If DIV register is writen, DIV internal counter is reseted, so TIMER is affected. For example, if a program configures the timer to increase every 64 clocks but it keeps writing to DIV register each 20 clocks, the timer will never increase its value.

-Timer/DIV counter keeps increasing even if the timer is disabled. TIMA can increase just when the timer is enabled or it can need the specified clocks by TAC. TODO: TEST SPECIFICALLY THIS ON HARDWARE!!
