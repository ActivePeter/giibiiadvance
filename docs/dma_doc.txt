DMG DMA transfer
----------------

rDMA is (R/W)

-Copy from VRAM or external RAM doesn't disable WRAM or ROM.

-Source address to trigger the DMA copy can be 0x0000-0xFF00.


GBC DMA transfer
----------------

rHDMA1-rHDMA4 are (W) - They read FFh.
rHDMA5 is (R/W)

-If a HDMA transfer is inited when the screen is off, when it is turned on it will start. It will copy 1 block when the screen is off.

-When a HDMA transfer is inited during HBL it will start right away. There is no problem of copying while VRAM is inaccesible, mode 2 is long enough to allow the HDMA copy the 16 bytes.

-If rHDMA5 is writen during a HDMA copy:
    -Bit 7 of rHDMA5 is 0: Stop copy. rHDMA5 reads FFh always, regardless of the other written bits.
    -Bit 7 of rHDMA5 is 1: Restart copy. New size is the value of rHDMA5 bits 0-6.
