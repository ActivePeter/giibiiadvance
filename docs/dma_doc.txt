DMG DMA transfer
----------------

rDMA is (R/W)

- Copy from VRAM or external RAM doesn't disable WRAM or ROM.

- Source address to trigger the DMA copy can be 0x0000-0xFF00.


GBC DMA transfer
----------------

rHDMA1-rHDMA4 are (W) - They read FFh.
rHDMA5 is (R/W)

- When a GDMA/HDMA transfer is finished/stopped, triggering another one without setting source/destination will use as source/destination the continuation of last copy.

- If a HDMA transfer is inited when the screen is off, when it is turned on it will start.

- HDMA will only copy 1 block when the screen is off. It will continue after the screen is turned on. When triggering the copy the CPU will wait the setup time and one copy time together.

- When a HDMA transfer is inited during HBL it will start right away. There is no problem of copying while VRAM is inaccesible, mode 2 is long enough to allow the HDMA copy the 16 bytes.

-If rHDMA5 is written during a HDMA copy:
    -Bit 7 of rHDMA5 is 0: Stop copy. rHDMA5 reads (80h OR written_value).
    -Bit 7 of rHDMA5 is 1: Restart copy. New size is the value of rHDMA5 bits 0-6.
 This means that HDMA can't switch to GDMA with only one write.

Timing for GDMA:

    blocks = (register_value & 0x7F) + 1

    Double Speed -> ( 20 + blocks*64 ) clocks (Verify?)
    Single Speed -> ( 20 + blocks*32 ) clocks (Verify?)

Timing for HDMA:

    blocks = (register_value & 0x7F) + 1

    Setup timing (when writing to rHDMA5):
        16 clocks (double and single speed)

    Copy time (per HBL):
        Double Speed -> ( 4 + 64 ) clocks (Verify?)
        Single Speed -> ( 4 + 32 ) clocks (Verify?)
